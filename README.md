Autonomous Navigation using Reinforcement Learning

The project "Autonomous Navigation using Reinforcement Learning" aims to develop an intelligent system that enables a robot or vehicle to navigate through an environment autonomously using the principles of reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is a machine learning technique where an agent learns to make decisions through trial and error by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. In this project, the agent learns to navigate effectively and safely by optimizing its actions based on the feedback it receives.

Lengthy description aside, this is our team Project for my 5th Sem on B.E.
